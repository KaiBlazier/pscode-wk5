// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

a + b = c

num1 + num2 = sum
print sum

ask for 2 numbers 
add the 2 number together 
print on the screen the sum of those 2 numbers


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

IF num MOD 2 == 0
    PRINT num is even
ELSE
    PRINT num is odd
ENDIF

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

1.  Initialize an empty list, numbers
2.  FOR i from 1 to 5
3.      Prompt the user to enter a number
4.      Read the input number
5.      Add the input number to the list, numbers
6.  ENDFOR
7.  SET total to the sum of the numbers in the list
8.  SET average to total divided by 5
9.  SET min_number to the smallest number in the list, numbers
10. SET max_number to the largest number in the list, numbers
11. PRINT "The average of the five numbers is: ", average
12. PRINT "The smallest number entered is: ", min_number
13. PRINT "The largest number entered is: ", max_number
